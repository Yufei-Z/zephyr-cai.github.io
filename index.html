<p>I&rsquo;m currently a senior undergraduate student at Department of Mathematics, <a href="http://en.sjtu.edu.cn/">Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU)</a>. 
	I am also enrolled in <a href="https://zhiyuan.sjtu.edu.cn/">Zhiyuan Honors Program</a>, a pilot program for the Basic Sciences in China. 
	I am interested in the interplay between machine learning and mathematical optimization.</p>

<p>This summer, I worked as a research assistant at <a href="https://cs.illinois.edu/">Department of Computer Science</a>, 
	<a href="https://illinois.edu/">University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign <!--(UIUC)--></a><!--, with projects in deep graphical models for molecular generation-->.</p>

<p><strong>I am applying for Ph.D. and M.S. (leading to Ph.D.) this year!</strong></p>

<p><strong>Gradient-free Consensus-based Global Optimization Method (In Progress)</strong>

<div id="abs-consensus" style="display:none;">
<blockquote> In optimization problems posed by machine learning and data science, the objective functions are usually not necessarily regular enough. For this issue, we develop a new gradient-free method for global non-convex optimization, 
		with the knowledge gleaned from the interacting particle system and flock model. Particularly, we sampled different initial parameters of the loss function as “particles”, and described their interactions based on the relative distances 
		between certain particles and their weighted average. Inspired by statistical physics, we formulated an average weighted by the Gibbs distribution corresponding to the objective function. Under several conditions, it could be proven that 
		sampling particles would relax towards their weighted average exponentially fast, and such a consensus state would provide a good approximation for the global minima. Now I am working on relevant numerical experiments, especially for non-convex 
		optimization problems like compressive sensing and logistic regression with l<sub>0</sub> regularization.</blockquote>

<p><strong>Auto-regressive Graphical Model for Molecular Generation</strong>

<div id="abs-generative" style="display:none;">
<blockquote> The recent boom of graphical models extends the domain knowledge ML could exploit, promising potential algorithms to discover and analyze structure in complex distributions. We proposed a new deep framework 
	of auto-regressive generative model for molecular graph generation. We represented molecules in graphs and formalized the graph generation as a sequential decision process. We further improved the preformance 
	by designing an innovative generating process with node degree constraints and subgraph generating tokens. Training auto- regressive generative models tends to take time, so I accelerated training by batching graphs 
	and multiprocessing on CPUs. Our model eventually achieved high performance in similarity metrics comparable to recent state-of-the-art algorithms on the Molecular Sets benchmarking platform. </blockquote>

<blockquote>
		We designed the SPEC index to evaluate regional fragility concerning effects of climate change, and formulated the self-regulatory factor to model the tipping-point of regional stabilities.
		We futher collected and cleaned relevant data of 178 countries worldwide to test our model. Our SPEC score corresponded to the traditional Fragile State Index but stressed the effects of climate change.
		Eventually our team was designated as Outstanding Winner (top 0.16% in over 20,000 teams in the world).
